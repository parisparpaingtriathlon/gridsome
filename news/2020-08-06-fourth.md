You did a terrible thing. It doesn't mean you're a terrible person. Be better than anyone here, and don't give a damn what anyone thinks. If she was a man, you'd say she was formidable, or bold, or right. Never give in. Never give up. Stand up. Stand up and take it.

Another thing I just don't do anymore is wax. So it's 1976 down there. Screw beautiful. I'm brilliant! You want to appease me, compliment my brain! I am not a toy you can play with when you're bored, or lonely, or horny. I am fine dancing alone.

I am strong and I am comfortable with being strong. I want painful, devastating, life-changing, extraordinary love. Donâ€™t let what he wants eclipse what you need. He's very dreamy, but he's not the sun. You are. So I'm bisexual. So what? It's a thing and it's real.
